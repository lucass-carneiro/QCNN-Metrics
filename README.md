# Intro

This is a python package for training Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) for fitting functions and solving differential equations. It uses Pennylane for building quantum circuits and can be trained with Numpy or Torch backends. The code also supports checkpoints, recovery and streaming IO via the ADIOS2 library.

Detailed installation and usage instructions are available in the Documentation
