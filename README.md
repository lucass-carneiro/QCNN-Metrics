# QCNN Toolkit

This is a python package whose primary objective is to train Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) for fitting functions and solving differential equations. It is written in Python, uses Pennylane for building quantum circuits and can be trained with Numpy or Torch backends. The Torch backend supports training on GPUs. The code also supports output checkpoints, recovery and streaming IO via the ADIOS2 library.
